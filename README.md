Python notebook containing the project


Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/imdb-movie-ratings-sentiment-analysis?select=movie.csv

Built a sentiment analysis model using NLTK’s Naïve Bayes classifier trained on movie reviews on IMDB Dataset. 
I employed data cleaning and normalizing methods like lemmatization and finally achieved an accuracy of 85%  


Model that helps in predicting whether a review is positive or negative.


Dependencies
I used the nltk library's naive bayes classifier to classify the tweet into positive,negative or neutral.

The following are the dependencies you need to install before running the model

punkt,stopwords,state_union,averaged_perceptron_tagger,wordnet,maxent_treebank_pos_tagger
